{ Primality testing }

program Prime:
  n := 127  { 2 ^ 7 - 1 is a Mersenne prime }
  i := 2
  isPrime := 1  { assume n is prime until we prove otherwise }
  
  { The program really only needs to check values
    up to sqrt(n), but we don't have an easy way
    to calculate square roots, so we'll just
    check everything up to n }
  
  while i < n:
    if n % i = 0:
      isPrime := 0  { we now know n is divisible by i and not prime }
      i := n
    endif
  
    i := i + 1
  endwhile
  
  print isPrime { Prints 1 }
end
